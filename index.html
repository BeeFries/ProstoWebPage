            A fully independent Ukraine emerged only late in the 20th century,
            after long periods of successive domination by Poland-Lithuania,
            Russia, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.).
            Ukraine had experienced a brief period of independence in 1918–20,
            but portions of western Ukraine were ruled by Poland, Romania, and
            Czechoslovakia in the period between the two World Wars, and Ukraine
            thereafter became part of the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian Soviet
            Socialist Republic (S.S.R.). When the Soviet Union began to unravel
            in 1990–91, the legislature of the Ukrainian S.S.R. declared
            sovereignty (July 16, 1990) and then outright independence (August
            24, 1991), a move that was confirmed by popular approval in a
            plebiscite (December 1, 1991). With the dissolution of the U.S.S.R.
            in December 1991, Ukraine gained full independence. The country
            changed its official name to Ukraine, and it helped to found the
            Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), an association of
            countries that were formerly republics of the Soviet Union.
